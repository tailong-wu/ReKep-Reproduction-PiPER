# Explanation:
# The task is "Grasp a strawberry and place it in the plate."
# From the image, keypoints 4, 5, 6, 7 are strawberries, and 0, 1, 2 are on the plate.
# The task can be broken down into 2 stages:
# 1. Grasp a strawberry (let's choose keypoint 4 for concreteness).
# 2. Place the strawberry in the plate (let's use the center of the plate, which can be approximated as the mean of keypoints 0, 1, 2).
