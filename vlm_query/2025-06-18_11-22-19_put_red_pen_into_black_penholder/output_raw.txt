# The task "put red pen into black penholder" involves 3 stages:
# 1. Grasp the red pen by aligning the end-effector with its keypoint.
# 2. Align the red pen with the penholder opening. This involves positioning the pen 10 cm above the penholder opening while keeping the robot grasping the red pen.
# 3. Drop the red pen into the penholder by releasing the red pen keypoint. The pen must be directly aligned with the penholder opening before release.
